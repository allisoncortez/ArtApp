# ArtMake App

ArtMake is an app designed to encourage artist collaboration and creativity through artistic challenges. 


## Installation

To get Plantmom up and running, fork and clone this repo:

``https://github.com/allisoncortez/ArtApp.git``

You'll need to cd into the project directory and run ``bundle install``. All the gem dependancies will then be installed.

## Running Tests

In the terminal, please run ``rails s``. It will open up a local server address where you can route to that address and look at the project. It will look something like this:

> http://127.0.0.1:9494/


## App Navigation

The first window users are greeted with is a welcome page!
You can browse through existing challenges BUT you won't be able to join any challenges unless you've signed up for an account.

The main navbar inclues
1. Add a Plant
2. All Plants
3. My Plants (this lets you view the plants you've logged)
4. Logout
